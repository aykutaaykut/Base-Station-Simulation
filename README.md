# Base-Station-Simulation
This is a simulation project for base stations. Arena Input Analyzer is used with *data.xls* in order to determine the distributions of interarrival times between calls, call durations and car velocities. The source code of the project is under the *src* folder. *commons-math3-3.6.1.jar* is necessary for generating random numbers according to certain distributions.
